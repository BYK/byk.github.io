_\*Clicks fingers, clears throat\*_

Okay, I have procrastinated on this post for, _checks notes_, 3 months now. It's time. Time to let go of all the bad memories and the pain.

See, all I wanted to do was to [create a terminal application][1] that you can just download and run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
I also got a bit ambitious and wanted to create this app on, _\*gasp\*_, Linux! And you know, it worked on Windows.
Yeah, _that_ Windows that every developer loves to hate but secretly uses one way or another. But macOS? No no no no no, tsk tsk tsk, not so fast little boy.
You need to sign & notarize your stuff, and you need to do it **The Apple Way™**.

## The Apple Way™

The very first thing Apple wants is ~~your money~~ an Apple Developer account which will [set you back $99][2][^1]. Every year that is.
Oh, and you cannot _just_ create a developer account. You see, you need One Apple Account™.
If this is going to be a personal developer account, you _just_ need your name, email, phone number, and your address[^2]. If you are trying to enroll your organization, god help you: you need your [D-U-N-S number][3].[^3]

Now that we have warmed up, it is time for you to create an identifier for your application.
They recommend using a reverse-domain like name: `com.my-company.my-app`. I know, you just want to self-distribute a simple binary.
Yes, you still need the unique identifier. No, you cannot use `asdf` or `foobar`.
Okay head over to [identifier creation page][4] and get it over with please. I'll `await`.
I _think_ you leave the capabilities empty.

## Switching to the Highway

After this step we need to add a certificate to our account. Now, if you have XCode, there's a built in UI for this. But remember,
we don't have access to macOS where XCode can only survive in. Hence we will go rogue and will create a certificate signing request
(CSR) using the command line. We need a "private key" to create a CSR so we'll be creating that via the CLI too.
Might seem complicated but it is just answering a bunch of questions and shuffling some files around.

For this, we'll be needing 2 tools:

1. `openssl`[^4]
1. [`rcodesign`][5]

Let's start with the private key:

```shell
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
```

Now that we have generated our private key in `private.pem`, we can create the CSR using `rcodesign`:

```shell
rcodesign generate-certificate-signing-request --pem-file private.pem --csr-pem-file csr.pem
```

Okay, we have the signing request in `csr.pem`. Now we head to the page where you can [add a certificate][6]
and follow the steps below:

1. From the gazillion options, select **Developer ID Application**.
1. Select `G2 Sub-CA (Xcode 11.4.1 or later)` for **Profile Type**.
1. Upload the `csr.pem` file we just created.
1. Now we should arrive at a page saying "Download Your Certificate"
1. Save this file as `pass.cer` next to the other ones and keep them safe.
1. Download Apple's root certificate and convert to PEM format (Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority)

   ```shell
   wget http://developer.apple.com/certificationauthority/AppleWWDRCA.cer
   # Convert that to PEM format
   openssl x509 -inform der -in AppleWWDRCA.cer -out AppleWWDRCA.pem
   # Convert pass.cer to PEM format
   openssl x509 -inform der -in pass.cer -out pass.pem
   ```

1. Note down your cert expiration date. You'll need to do this entire dance again some days before this date:

   ```shell
   openssl x509 -in pass.pem -noout -enddate
   ```

1. Now we are going to combine everything into a p12 file.
   Make sure to replace `Company Name` in the command line arguments below with your company name or your name.

   ```shell
   openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -inkey pass.pem -in pass.pem -certfile AppleWWDRCA.pem -name "Company Name" -out codesign.p12 -passout pass:
   ```

1. Before finishing, we need to note down your Team ID:

   ```shell
   openssl pkcs12 -in codesign.p12 -nodes | grep OU
   ```

At this point, you only need the final `codesign.p12` file. We made it **not** password protected so you can use it in your CI/CD
pipeline without having to enter a password. If you'd rather have it password protected, run the command above without `-passout pass:` at the end.

## Apple's Sacred Stamp of Approval

To be admitted to Apple's sacred notarization service, you need to get an App Store Connect API key.
If you enjoy a good read from Apple go [read their documentation][7].
For the twitchy ones, like myself:

1. Head to [API Key Creation][8] page
1. Click on the **+** next to **Active** at the top of the table.
1. Enter a name like `Code Signing`
1. Put `Developer` for the **Access** field
1. Hit **Generate**
1. Notice the **Download** button in the last column for the key you just created (bottom row)
1. Download and save the key with the name `apikey.p8` next to `codesign.p12`
1. Note the **Key ID** somewhere
1. Note the **Issuer ID** somewhere. This is a separate section above the key table.
1. Now let's combine all these 3 into a single JSON file so we don't have to manage them separately:

   ```shell
   rcodesign encode-app-store-connect-api-key -o codesign_key.json <issuer-id> <key-id> apikey.p8
   ```

At this point you only need the `codesign_key.json` file. This will be used for notarization.

## The Entitled Apps

To be able to get your app notarized, it needs to have "entitlements". This is essentially letting Apple know
ahead of time, which sensitive APIs your application will be using. Then Apple's servers will issue a "ticket"
for this specific version of your app and when someone tries to run it, it will be checked and restrained to
these limitations.

Since I don't have cybernetic powers, I cannot (yet) deduce which entitlements your app needs over a blog post.
That said I can at least make a recommendation. Since I did this for fossilized Node.js applications, [I just
copied][9] what Node.js used for itself.

You can use this or create your own by picking and choosing from [the vast array of entitlements][10]
that Apple offers. There's also [more excellent prose][11]
for those to understand deeper and follow the Apple cult even closer.

At the end of this section, I'll just assume you have an `entitlements.plist` file that is
[properly formatted][12][^5] next to the binary
you want to sign and notarize.

## Sign here please[^6]

Now that we got everything we need for signing _and_ notarization, we can get to actual business.
Signing is quite straightforward but getting the notarization right took a few tries. Let's start with signing:

```shell
rcodesign sign --team-name <your_team_id> --p12-file codesign.p12 --for-notarization -e entitlements.plist <your_binary_path>
```

If you opted for a password-protected p12 file above, you can add `--p12-password <password>` or
`--p12-password-file <password_file_path>` at the end of the command above.

## Knock Knock Knocking on Notary's Door

Now that we have a signed binary, we will get it notarized. We already got the prerequisites by using the `--for-notarization` and
`-e entitlements.plist` parts above so we are in good hands. We still need to zip the file before though[^7].

```shell
zip app.zip <path_to_your_app>
rcodesign notary-submit --api-key-file codesign_key.json --wait app.zip
rm app.zip
```

## We're Done Here

Yup, we really are done. At this point you can start distributing the signed binary. People using a macOS should be able to use it without errors or warnings.
If they double click on it (instead of running from a terminal), they may still see a security warning as we cannot "staple" the notarization tickets to plain binaries. To be able to do this you
need to package your app as a `.pkg` or `.dmg` file but I wasn't (and still am not) interested in learning more Apple stuff so you'll need to figure that part out
yourself.

If you want to have this process on a CI/CD pipeline you need to remember a few things:

1. Make sure you don't do signing and notarization on PR branches as that means anyone who can create a PR can generate and distribute a binary with their potentially
   malicious changes and with _your_ signature on it.
1. I don't think you need to password-protect your p12 file but if you are using a service like GitHub you probably cannot store files as secrets. A quick hack for
   this is to store the `base64` encoded string versions of these 2 files (`codesign.p12` and `codesign_key.json`) as secrets. Then you
   [`base64` decode these into their respective files][13]
   and continue business as usual.
1. Also, don't forget to [store the _signed_ binary][14] as the artifact of your build.

## Resources

I've used the excellent docs [Gregory Szorc][15] created for his amazing [`apple-codesign`][16] project.
I essentially summarized these two pages:

- https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/main/apple_codesign_certificate_management.html#apple-codesign-exchange-csr
- https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/main/apple_codesign_getting_started.html#apple-codesign-app-store-connect-api-key

I also found [this amazing gist for creating `pkpass.p12` files][17] from the GitHub user
[karnauskas][18] and used parts of it.

Finally, I've used [this little hack from StackOverflow][19] for providing you with
a command for creating password-less p12 files from the get go.

[^1]: You need to scroll all the way to the bottom to see this very unimportant detail.
[^2]: Yep, I'm being snarky.
[^3]: First time I heard about it. I wish patience to people dealing with Apple. And no, I have no intention of learning more about this but you have that link there.
[^4]: If you don't have `openssl` around, just search for how you can install it. Should be as easy as `<package_manager> install openssl` where `<package_manager>` is `apt` or `yum` or something akin to those.
[^5]: Being a bit picky, are we dear Apple?
[^6]: and here, and here, and here, and here...
[^7]: Don't ask me why they cannot be bothered with on-the-fly zipping or HTTP content encoding etc., I don't know.
